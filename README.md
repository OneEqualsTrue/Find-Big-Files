# Find-Big-Files
This simple Java program parses through every file on your computer (external and internal) and displays files bigger than 100MB (or whatever the preset value is)

###### Compile to a .jar file with the following line:
```
java -jar bigg.jar 100
```
- Change 100 to any file size upper limit
- Change 100 to $1 to add upper limit as parameter in execution (ex. ./bigg.jar 200)
